### jQuery and AJAX


Use AJAX to perform a GET request to `/api/jokes`
`console.log` the response

```



```

Given a form with id 'newJoke' which contains two input fields: 
one text input with id 'title' and another with id 'content'
Use jQuery to save the form data to a variable called 'newJoke'

```




```

Use AJAX to make a POST request to `/api/jokes'`
Include the `newJoke` variable from above as data.
  
```



```  

### Event Listeners

Given the following HTML

```html
<button id="myBtn">Click me</button>
```

Use vanilla JavaScript (no jQuery) to write an event listener which will change
the button's text to 'Ouch!'

```



```

### Mongoose & Express 

Given an Express App using Mongoose and a Joke model...
Write a route to handle GET requests to `/api/jokes`
that responds with all the Jokes from your mongoDB as JSON.

```js 





```

Rewrite the following using a template literal string


```
"Hello " + user.name + " it is now " + new Date()



```

Rewrite using fat arrow syntax

```
function area(l, w) {
    return l + w
}




```

Rewrite using let and const

```
var numbers = [1, 2, 3];
var sum = 0;
for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    var number = numbers[i];
    sum += number;
}
```

```




```  

Instead of returning the answer rewrite the function to take an additional
callback and pass the data to it.

```
function area(l, w) {
    return l + w
}
```

```




```
