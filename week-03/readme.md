# Arrays

Given the following array 

```
var list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

Remove one from the beginning of the array and add it to the end

```

```

# Objects

Create an object with key value pairs for `name` - a string, `isAlive` - a boolean, and `hobbies` an array.
Assign the object to the variable `user`

```





```

Add 'golf' to the `user`'s `hobby` array.

```

```

# Functions

Define a function `sayHello` that takes a name string and returns "Hello" plus that name and an exclamation point.
Example: 

```
sayHello('Mer') // "Hello Mer!"
```

```



```

Define a function `createRange` that takes `min` and `max` as parameters and returns an array with all the numbers
between min and max
Example: 

```
createRange(4, 8) // [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

```



```

# Callbacks

Given the following array...

use `.filter` to select only odd numbers
then `.map` to double each filtered number
then `.reduce` to sum the doubled numbers

```
var list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
```

```




```

#Scopes

Create a variable in the global scope called name, then write a function called thisName, and create another variable inside the function called name, and console.log name. What do you think the output would be?

```
